The Challenge

It’s difficult to fathom just how vast and diverse our natural world is.

There are over 5,000 species of mammals, 10,000 species of birds, 30,000 species of fish – and astonishingly, over 400,000 different types of flowers.

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images (for simplicity, we’re sticking to just over 100 types).
